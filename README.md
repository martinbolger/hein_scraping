# hein_scraping

This code is designed to scrape data on legal publications from the website Hein Online. It takes a list of law professors as input and outputs a list of publications found on pages associated with the author. It also combines the table of statstics on all possible author pages for each author. 

Data in Hein Online for individual authors is not clearly consolidated onto one page. For many authors, papers published with different name variations (e.g., with or without middle initial) will not show up on the same page. There also can be issues when two authors with similar names are listed. Not all author pages have an associated school, so it is also important to check that the page belongs to the correct author by checking search results for links related to the school.
